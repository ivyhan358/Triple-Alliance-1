            <p>
                The various parks in Pyin Oo Lwin often attract lots of visitors and it 
                is important for these visitors to enjoy themselves when visiting. To achieve 
                this various types of facilities and equipment are required. These facilities 
                and equipment serve a wide range of purposes and is how some parks make revenue.

            <h2>Playgrounds</h2>
            <p>
                The first reason why these parks were created was the result of economical reasoning. These parks are built to be a major 
                tourist attraction that aims to draw hundreds of thousands of tourists and visitors, local or foreign year-round. This is especially noticeable 
                during the summer where it is the time for flower festival seasons. These huge influx of visitors supports the local businesses 
                such as shops and food venders as well as benefiting flower and vegetable productions and hospitality services.

                    The second reason why these parks were created was the result of education and beautification. 
                    One of these parks, the National Kandawgyi Botanical Garden was to serve as a research hub for 
                    Alex Roger and others during the British colonial era of Myanmar, with facilities such as orchid gardens, 
                    and butterfly museum present in the park. The park was also planned to serve an educational purpose, as 
                    it was intended to educate people and visitors about conservation and to spark a love and appreciation for trees and flowers alike.
