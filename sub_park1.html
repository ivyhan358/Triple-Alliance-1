            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>
                The beautiful city, called Pyin Oo Lwin, has an abundance of parks that have been around for the last 110 years. 
                Some of these parks are often renowned for their abundance of wildlife and greenery that can be found within the parks. 
                The parks all have different reasons as to why they were built and as the years pass by some of these parks gained very positive 
                reputations and notoriety from burmese citizens and media. They are often featured in films, magazines and other forms 
                of media with one of these parks, The National Kandawagyi Botanical Gardens being considered a protected forest area and a national heritage sight.
                Though there were many reasons, only the 2 most importanat reasosn will be covered below.

            <h2>Economicial</h2>
            <p>
                The first reason why these parks were created was the result of economical reasoning. These parks are built to be a major 
                tourist attraction that aims to draw hundreds of thousands of tourists and visitors, local or foreign year-round. This is especially noticeable 
                during the summer where it is the time for flower festival seasons. These huge influx of visitors supports the local businesses 
                such as shops and food venders as well as benefiting flower and vegetable productions and hospitality services.

                <h2>Research & Education</h2>
                <p>
                    The second reason why these parks were created was the result of education and beautification. 
                    One of these parks, the National Kandawgyi Botanical Garden was to serve as a research hub for 
                    Alex Roger and others during the British colonial era of Myanmar, with facilities such as orchid gardens, 
                    and butterfly museum present in the park. The park was also planned to serve an educational purpose, as 
                    it was intended to educate people and visitors about conservation and to spark a love and appreciation for trees and flowers alike.
